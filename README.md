## What is Link?
Link is a basic webserver library that I made in C++

## How is this hosted
I used Nginx for SSL and to allow for subdomains, and hosted it on AWS.

## How to run
Make sure you have `build-essential` or gcc and make as well as [Link](https://github.com/N11Software/Link).
> Warning: This will only work on Linux!
```shell
make
```
```shell
make run
```
